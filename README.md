## Lab Assignment 3

This assignment was to incorporate the use of previous mouse positions. I used the difference between the mouse positions to draw a trailing line behind the cursor, as well as control the color of the background and the cursor size.

## Lab Assignment 4

In this assignment I used mouse clicks and key presses to trigger changes to the circle on the screen. The animation was inspired by dvr screensavers.

## Lab Assignment 7

This assignment was to use _**for** loops_. I used one to create stars that fade away after time. The starsâ€™ position is based off of the mouse position, so you have to keep moving your mouse across the screen to draw the night sky.
